Question 1: A Class represents a blueprint and an object would be [a Method or an Object (variable)].
Question 2: OOP = [Object Oriented Programming]
Question 3: Applications that can be created with Visual Studio include: [Web Forms, Windows Forms, Model View Controller, Console Application, Xamarin]
Question 4: [CTS = Common Type System; CLS = Common Language Specification; CLR = Common Language Runtime; JIT = Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation]
Question 5: Primitive types are also known as [data types]
Question 6: A Byte can store [up to 256 bits]
Question 7: A Char can only store 1 character
Question 8: ???
Question 9: A double data type is 8 bytes
Question 10: POCO = Plain Old Class Object; Plain Old CLR Object
Question 11: You can create a custom value type in C# by using the struct keyword
Question 12: An entity is anything that has a unique, separate, existence
Question 13: Short is also called Int16 (it is short in comparison to Int = Int32)
Question 14: Long is also called Int64 (it is long in comparison to Int = Int32)
Question 15: Unsigned data types can not be negative (because it is unsigned; no "-")
Question 16: False, WriteLine is a Method of the Console class, which exists within the System Class
Question 17: The WriteLine method having 19 overloads is an example of static polymorphism
[]
Question 19: An escape sequence is "\" (backslash). To escape an escape sequence you would use the escape sequence twice "\\".
Question 20: 3 different ways of concatenating strings: (string string1 = "hello"; string string2 = "world";). 1. Console.WriteLine(string1 + string2); 2. Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", string1, string 2); 3. Console.WriteLine($"{string1} {string2}");
Question 21: To search for a substring within a string (given string exampleString = "This is an example";) one would write: "bool check = exampleString.Contains("example");" which would return a value of True for the boolean variable named "check"
Question 22: False; StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it is able to be mutated
Question 23: False; Verbatim Literal (@) will print the string verbatim
Question 24: The function of garbage collection is to reclaim memory from unused objects within a Programming
Question 25: True; Modulus (%) returns a quotient
Question 26: Math.Round rounds the value to the nearest whole number, Math.Truncate removes the decimal value
Question 27: ???
Question 28: The ternary operator is more efficient because it uses less lines of code to perform the same function
Question 29: The noal coalescing operator can pass a predefined value to a nonnullable variable in the case that a null value is attributed to that variable
Question 30: True; XML documentation comments are used to provide tips on Method/Class usage
Question 31: False; unless they are a nullable type of a primitive datatype for example int?, string?
Question 32: by placing a ? at the end of the datatype, for example int? is a nullable int variable. Another way would be Nullable<int>. And the third way would be to use the ?? operator.
Question 33: False; it's valid for converting a smaller data type to a larger one
Question 34: By using the Convert.To method
Question 35: TryParse would help prevent the program from crashing, instead it would output a custom catch/error message
Question 36: False
Question 37: False
Question 38: True
Question 39: The ArrayList can be found inside the System.Collections namespace
Question 40: if/elseif/else statements check each condition, while switch cases only run through the applicable case condition
Question 41: The do-while loop runs the instructed code once and then checks conditoins, while a while loop only passes instructions to be run when/while a certain condition is met
Question 42: True: it can, but that's not all it does
Question 43
